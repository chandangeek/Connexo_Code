<p style="margin-bottom:12pt">User roles determine which users have access to which application and what and what not they can do in this application. User roles are used to group privileges into sets
    that can be assigned to different users. Every user assigned with a specific user role has all of the privileges included in that role. When a user is assigned multiple roles, then the user will
    have all of the privileges of each role.</p>
