/**
 * Models a timeline that can be configured to produce {@link Event}s
 * that occur on fixed points in time or on recurring points in time.
 * To facilitate the occurrence of the Events, you will configure
 * {@link DayType}s on which Events occur, divide the calendar
 * into {@link Period}s and specify the DayType for every
 * human calendar weekday. This provides a means to define
 * a standard week within that Period but there will obviously
 * be exceptions to these general rules or standards.
 * This is were {@link ExceptionalOccurrence}s come into play.
 * <p>
 * Calendars can extend another one, taking advantage of the occurrence
 * of events and map those events to others. In this way, it should
 * be possible to create a calendar that models the holidays
 * for the region where your system is operating in. Such a holiday
 * calendar would produce a single Event: holiday and also
 * a single DayType: holiday. All know holidays can be configured
 * to occur in this calendar. An extending calendar for e.g.
 * an electricity supplier that support off peak and on peak tariffs
 * could then map the holiday event to its own 'off peak' Event.
 * It suffices for an operator to add an additional holiday to the
 * base calendar and all extending calendars would be 'updated' as well.
 * Important note: the above feature of extension is not supported yet.
