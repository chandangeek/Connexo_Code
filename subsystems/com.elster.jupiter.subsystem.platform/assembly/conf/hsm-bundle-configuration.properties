# This should be absolute path to JSS (Maintenance) exported configuration (used to initialize JSS)

# Following configuration is needed to add flexibility on import feature: allowing to use different labels in imported files.
# With this approach however we will allow only one mapping, perhaps a better approach would be to add this mapping on importer configuration
# allowing mapping for each importer.

# all labels with structure: hs.config.label.<>

# format hsm.config.label.[HSM-LABEL] = [FILE-LABEL], [CHAINING-MODE], [PADDING-ALGORITHM]
# where:
#				 HSM-LABEL a label that is provisioned inside HSM
#                FILE-LABEL is the corresponding label present in import file. If values are the same in file and HSM you can omit this field.
#                CHAINING-MODE can have following one of the following JSS values: ECB,CBC,CFB or OFB; This will be used for calling Symmetric and Asymmetric encrypt/decrypt calls but not for import* while there we use mapping configured in shipment file.
#                PADDING-ALGORITHM can have following one of the following JSS values: NONE, NULL, LEFT_NULL, ISO_9797_80M, ISO_9797_O80, ANSI_X9_23, EMSA_PKCS1_V1_5, EME_PKCS1_V1_5, PKCS . This will be used for calling Symmetric and Asymmetric encrypt/decrypt calls but not for import* while there we use mapping configured in shipment file
