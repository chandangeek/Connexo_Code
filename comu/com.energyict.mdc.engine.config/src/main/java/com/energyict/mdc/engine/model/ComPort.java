/**
 * Models a port that can be used to communicate with a device.
 * This will actually map onto a port of a physical machine
 * on which a {@link ComServer} is configured to run.
 * Therefore, a ComPort is said to be dedicated to that
 * particular ComServer.
 * <p/>
 * The types of ports are devided in two main categories that
 * relate to the in or outbound nature of the communication.
 * Outbound communication is initiated by the ComServer
 * while inbound communication is initiated by the device.
 * An inbound communication port will therefore wait for
 * connection attempts against the port from a device.
 * Outbound communication ports will sit in a {@link ComPortPool pool}
 * waiting for the communication server to start communications
 * with a device. At that time, the ComPort will be in use.
 * <p/>
 * Several types of inbound communications are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Modem based</li>
 * <li>IP based</li>
 * <li>Servlet based</li>
 * </ul>
 * Specific subclasses will focus on the attributes that
 * relate to each of the types mentioned above.
