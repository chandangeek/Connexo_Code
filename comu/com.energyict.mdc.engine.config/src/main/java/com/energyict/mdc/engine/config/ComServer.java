/**
 * Models a server that will schedule communication with devices.
 * The communication is done through {@link ComPort}s.
 * By convention, the name of a ComServer is the name
 * of the physical machine the server is running on.<br>
 * Once started, a ComServer will poll the database to detect
 * changes that were applied to all objects that relate to the ComServer.
 * As such, it will detect the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Changing active/inactive flag of the ComServer</li>
 * <li>Changing server log level of the ComServer</li>
 * <li>Changing communication log level of the ComServer</li>
 * <li>Changing the changesInterPollDelay of the ComServer</li>
 * <li>Changing active/inactive flags of related ComPorts</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Each time a ComTaskExecution is executed,
 * one of the ComPorts of the ComServer that executes the ScheduledComTask
 * will be used to connect to the device.
 * A ComSession is created that captures all the details
 * of the communication with the device. That communication overview
 * is obviously very imported and should not be deleted easily.
 * Therefore, objects that relate to the communication overview
 * are never deleted but made obsolete instead.
 * Obsolete ComServers will not return from ComServerFactory
 * finder methods.
