<p style="margin-bottom:12pt">A logbook categorizes events that have occurred on a device. A single logbook can contain different types of events. A device can have more than one logbook. Each logbook
    has its own unique identifier, which is needed to retrieve its contents from the device. The content of the logbook is recorded during periodic communication to a device. Typical events that are
    recorded are power outages, connection status, firmware logging, etc.</p>
