It usually requires human intervention to analyse and fix the problem, although some issues can be fixed simply by automatically retrying them. The details of an issue and how to solve them depends on the type of task from which it originates. Issues can be assigned to a particular user or user group to solve it.\" />   <entry name=\"issue creation rules\" value=\"Rules to define which events automatically trigger an issue and which actions should be taken.\" />   <entry name=\"load profile\" value=\"A load profile is an object containing one or more channels with the same reading interval.\" />   <entry name=\"load profile configuration\" value=\"A load profile configuration contains further specification of different load profile parameters that are specific for a certain device configuration.\" />   <entry name=\"load profile types\" value=\"A load profile type contains all essential load profile parameters so that this load profile type can be reused for different device types and device configurations, but it doesn’t contain values.\" />   <entry name=\"logbook\" value=\"A logbook categorizes events that have occurred on a device. A single logbook can contain different types of events. A device can have more than one logbook. Each logbook has its own unique identifier, which is needed to retrieve its contents from the device. The content of the logbook is recorded during periodic communication to a device. Typical events that are recorded are power outages, connection status, firmware logging, etc.\" />   <entry name=\"logbook configuration\" value=\"A logbook configuration contains further specification of different logbook parameters that are specific for a certain device configuration.\" />   <entry name=\"logbook types\" value=\"A logbook type contains all essential logbook parameters so that this logbook type can be reused for different device types and device configurations, but it doesn’t contain values.\" />   <entry name=\"master data\" value=\"Registers, load profiles and logbooks\" />   <entry name=\"OBIS code\" value=\"OBIS stands for Object Identification System.

This can be for example the viewing, adding, editing or removing of a communication server. A resource is a component of an application, e.g. role is a resource as well as issue rules, licenses and communication servers.\" />   <entry name=\"protocol dialect\" value=\"Some tasks require specific properties such as the ability to download a large amount of data as it is often the case for firmware upgrades. Such specific properties can be acquired by configuring protocol dialects.\" />   <entry name=\"reading type\" value=\"A reading type provides a detailed description of a reading value. It is described using 18 key attributes separated by a dot.\" />   <entry name=\"register\" value=\"A register is a placeholder for data about a device or data measured by the device.
