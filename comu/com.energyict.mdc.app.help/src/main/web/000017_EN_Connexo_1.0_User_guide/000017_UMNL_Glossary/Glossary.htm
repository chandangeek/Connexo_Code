 <p class="FM_HGlossary">C</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Channel</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A channel is a representation of metered data (a single series of data), where each value is an exact amount of time apart from its neighbouring value. (e.g. 15 minutes).</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">CIM</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The Common Information Model is an international standard created and used by the utility industry to allow better exchange of data between parties.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication port</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A communication port is a physical modem (GSM, PSTN, etc.) or a logical connection (TCP, UDP, LAN, etc.). A communication port sets up a connection between the communication server and the device.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication port pool</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A communications port pool is a set of communication ports. The communication port pools can be grouped in ‘Inbound port pools’ and ‘Outbound port pools’. Typically communication port pools are spread over different communication servers.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication protocol</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A communication protocol defines the syntax of communication between different systems (e.g. between a communication server and a device) It consists of a system of message formats and rules for exchanging those messages. A single protocol can be used for multiple physical device models.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication schedule</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A communication schedule defines the time and recurrence for reading a particular set of meter data from a device or a group of devices.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication server</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Communication servers are the part of the system responsible for communicating with various devices in the field. A communication server is capable of communicating with several devices simultaneously using ports and pools of ports. It reads data from, writes data to or performs actions on these devices.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Communication task</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Is a group of commands the user defines and communicates with the device to make the device carry out a specific action, e.g. read registers, reset the clock, update firmware, etc.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Connection method</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Allows you to define how to communicate with the device. Some devices can support multiple types of connection methods (GRPS, optical, SMS, etc.).</p>
 <p class="FM_HGlossary">D</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Data logger</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A data logger is a device that stores data from other devices in its own channels. You do not know upfront which data these slave devices will have. The data logger does not save information of its data logger slave devices. You do not have to specify the slave devices before you can collect data, you can link the slave devices later.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Data source</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Registers, load profiles and logbooks</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A device represents a physical element (in the grid), this can be e.g. a meter, concentrator, gateway, in home display, etc.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device action</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A device action is part of a communication task and needs to be executed on a device when communicating with this device during a single connection.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device command</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Is used for infrequent adjustments of device parameters such as resetting a device. Device commands are only available when they are specified in a device protocol and this protocol is applied to the device type.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device configuration</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Device configurations are used to customise or limit some of the functionality of the device type, but also configure additional parameters to interact with the physical device. The device configuration will determine the actual register specifications together with the number of channels. It also contains information on security levels, connection methods, etc. </p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device command</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Is used for infrequent adjustments of device parameters such as resetting a device. Device commands are only available when they are specified in a device protocol and this protocol is applied to the device type.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device life cycle</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Is a collection of states a device goes through during its lifespan.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Device type</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A device type defines the capabilities of a physical device. Every device has exactly one device type that defines which data (such as registers, load profiles and logbooks) can be read from it and what communication protocol is used to read it. A device type maps to a single physical device model. but devices of this model can have different capabilities. This is achieved through device configurations.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Dynamic device group</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">is formed based on different search criteria. Single devices cannot be selected, all devices of the search result are part of the group. This group is dynamic because each time a new device that complies to the search criteria is added to the system, it will also be added to the device group.</p>
 <p class="FM_HGlossary">E</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Encryption</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Ensures that the information within a session is not compromised.</p>

 <p class="FM_HGlossary">G</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Gateway</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Device enabling the communication with (sub)meters by routing/translating the communication. A gateway will not store any data and works solely as a pas-through. Consequently the (sub)meter needs a protocol to read the data.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Ghost</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Ghost is the status of time of use calendars that originate from the device and that are not known in the Connexo system. For these time of use calendars no detailed information is available and it is not possible to preview such a time of use calendar. It can only be removed. Ghost time of use calendars can be introduced into Connexo by importing them. See <a><span class="FM_blue_crossreference">“</span><span class="FM_change_bar">Import time of use calendar</span><span class="FM_blue_crossreference">”</span></a>. Import file must be requested from the device manufacturer. The same concept also applies to firmware available on a device.</p>

 <p class="FM_Body">Data is pushed from the device to for example a communication server.</p>
 <p class="FM_PGlossary">Issue</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">An issue represents a problem that occurred during the execution of a manual or automated task. It usually requires human intervention to analyse and fix the problem, although some issues can be fixed simply by automatically retrying them. The details of an issue and how to solve them depends on the type of task from which it originates. Issues can be assigned to a particular user or user group to solve it.</p>
