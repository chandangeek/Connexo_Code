 <p class="FM_H3SectionTopic">Introduction to <uservariable x-value="MultiSense" x-showvalue="TRUE" name="MDC_App" x-format="MDC_App">MultiSense</uservariable></p>
 <p class="FM_Body">In <uservariable x-value="Connexo MultiSense" x-showvalue="TRUE" name="Product_name" x-format="Product_name">Connexo MultiSense</uservariable>&#160;different data collection features are spread over different pages. A small introduction to the different pages available in <uservariable x-value="MultiSense" x-showvalue="TRUE" name="MDC_App" x-format="MDC_App">MultiSense</uservariable>&#160;is given here. </p>
 <p class="FM_H4Topic">Dashboard</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">On the dashboard the meter operator can find the latest status of the items that he is responsible for. The overview shows the issues assigned to the operator together with the server status, active connections and communications.</p>
 <p class="FM_H4Topic">Workspace</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The workspace is the central location where users can see the status of data collection and validation as well as monitor tasks and issues. Different options are available for viewing the status of data collection, data validation, data export, as well as viewing tasks and issues linked to device operations.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The workspace is also the location to go to when you need to configure, execute and monitor firmware campaigns.</p>
 <p class="FM_PNote"><span class="FM_Icons">3</span></p>
 <p class="FM_PNote2"><span class="FM_Bold">Note</span></p>
 <p class="FM_BodyGrey">Depending on the privileges assigned to a specific user role the view of the workspace may vary for different users.</p>
 <p class="FM_H4Topic">Devices</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The <span class="FM_UIRef">Devices</span>&#160;page is the place in the application where you can manage all devices. On this page devices can be added. Links are provided to different device specific reports.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The device page is also the location where to create and manage device groups.</p>
 <p class="FM_H4Topic">Administration</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">Via the <span class="FM_UIRef">Administration</span>&#160;page all device features can be configured. This consist of the complete communication infrastructure (<a title="Communication servers are the part of the system responsible for communicating with various devices in the field. A communication server is capable of communicating with several devices simultaneously using ports and pools of ports. It reads data from, writes data to or performs actions on these devices.">communication server</a>s, <a title="A communication port is a physical modem (GSM, PSTN, etc.) or a logical connection (TCP, UDP, LAN, etc.). A communication port sets up a connection between the communication server and the device.">communication port</a>s, <a title="Is a group of commands the user defines and communicates with the device to make the device carry out a specific action, e.g. read registers, reset the clock, update firmware, etc.">communication task</a>s and <a title="A communication schedule defines the time and recurrence for reading a particular set of meter data from a device or a group of devices.">communication schedule</a>s, etc.), the <a title="A device type defines the capabilities of a physical device. Every device has exactly one device type that defines which data (such as registers, load profiles and logbooks) can be read from it and what communication protocol is used to read it. A device type doesn't necessarily map to a single physical device model. A device type may represent several models from various manufacturers as long as they have similar behaviour and characteristics.">device type</a>s and configurations, as well as validation and estimation rules and rules to create issues. Configuration is simplified by the use of templates in the form of shared communication schedules and tasks, data sources and device types. These have been developed in such a way that they can be used for multiple devices.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The administration page is divided in different panes that group together different parameters that are closely linked. E.g. all components to set up communication are grouped together in <span class="FM_UIRef">Device communication</span>.</p>
