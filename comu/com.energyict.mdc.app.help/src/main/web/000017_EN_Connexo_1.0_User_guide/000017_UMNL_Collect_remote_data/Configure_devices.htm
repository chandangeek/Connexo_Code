 <p class="FM_Body">A device type doesn't necessarily map to a single physical device model. It may represent several models from various manufacturers or different sub-models as long as they have similar behaviour and characteristics. This is achieved through the use of device configurations.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">A device type can have <span class="FM_Bold">multiple device configurations</span>. Device configurations are used to customise or limit some of the functionality of the device type, but also configure additional parameters to interact with the physical device. The device configuration will determine the actual register specifications together with the number of channels. It also contains information on security levels, connection methods, etc. </p>
 <p class="FM_Body">By using device configurations a more accurate representation of the physical device and its enabled functionality can be created. Configurations can be reused and facilitate the process of creating a large amount of similar devices.</p>

 <p class="FM_H4Topic">Understand device multipliers</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The need for a device multiplier relates to the usage of CT/VT (current transformer, voltage transformer) or pulse counting.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The first is used in heavy duty installations where the current or voltage of the system under measurement is too high for a measuring device to be connected directly. This is why a secondary circuit is built with reasonable current/voltage in which the measuring device is integrated. Anything that is measured by the device is then multiplied by the same factor that reduces the current/voltage from the main circuit to the secondary circuit. The multiplier is usually stable, but there are times when the needs of the consumer increase and the current/voltage of the main circuit changes. At that time, the conversion factor between the main and the secondary circuit would change and therefore also the device multiplier.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The second situation is used for devices that do not count actual consumption units but for example count pulses instead and each pulse then needs to be converted to the desired consumption unit. For example the typical household meter with the rotating wheel that produces a pulse each time the wheel completes a full circle. The speed of the wheel is determined by the amount of energy that is consumed, meaning that each pulse relates to the same amount of energy and can therefore be converted to kWh. The speed of the wheel is determined by the design of the meter and will remain the same for the lifetime of this device.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The CIM model also talks about device multipliers and distinguishes the actual measurement from the multiplied measurement by using a different reading type in case of measuring electricity. The commodity field of a reading type (digit 6) is responsible for this. In CIM language, the actual measurement is called the secondary measured value (because it was measured on the secondary circuit) and the real consumption, i.e. the result of applying the device multiplier is called the primary measured value.</p>
 <p class="FM_Body">The use of a multiplier is optional and can be used on a device. However not all the data of the device requires a multiplier, for example measuring volt, text registers, status registers, etc. This is why it is possible to indicate if a multiplier will be used or not on a configuration level. The value of the multiplier it set on the device level as typically this is different for each device.</p>
