/**
 * Models a {@link NumericalReading} that relates billing and is relevant in the context of the billing period.
 * Example: some energy contracts impose constraints on the maximum demand requested by the contractee.
 * The energy supplier will therefore want to know the maximum demand that was requested during the billing period.
 * The interval of the reading will be the billing period.
 * The timestamp of the reading is the timestamp at which the maximum demand occurred.
