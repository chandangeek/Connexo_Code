/**
 * Models a task that is able to establish a connection
 * with a device that is designed for communication.<br>
 * A ConnectionTask can be used by multiple devices,
 * allowing those devices to all use the same communication channel.
 * In that case, the device will most likely be a gateway-like device.
 * <p>
 * A ConnectionTask of type X cannot be created against a device if the
 * {@link com.energyict.mdc.device.config.DeviceConfiguration} does not support X.
 * Remember that support for type X on the configuration level is
 * managed with a {@link PartialConnectionTask}. Every ConnectionTask
 * will therefore be linked to the PartialConnectionTask from which
 * it was created and from which it can inherit connection properties.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link ConnectionType} does not support {@link com.energyict.mdc.common.ComWindow}s
 * then the ConnectionTask is NOT required to have a ComWindow.
 * In case there is a ComWindow, the ConnectionTask will only
 * establish a connection when the time is within the ComWindow.
 * This ComWindow is computed against the device's time zone.
 * <p>
 * Each time a ConnectionTask is executed, a ComSession
 * is created that captures all the details of the communication with the device.
 * That communication overview is very important and should not be deleted
 * easily. Therefore, ConnectionTasks are never deleted but made obsolete.
 * Obsolete ConnectionTasks will not return from {@link DeviceService} finder methods.
