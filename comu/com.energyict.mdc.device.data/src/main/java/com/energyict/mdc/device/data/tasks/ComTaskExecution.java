/**
 * Models the execution of a ComTask in the context of a connection with a device
 * for which an appropriate {@link ConnectionTask} exists.
 * <p>
 * A ComTaskExecution is either scheduled or ad hoc.
 * The difference is that a scheduled ComTaskExecution has a scheduling frequency
 * and an ad hoc ComTaskExecution has not frequency.
 * <p>
 * A ComTaskExecution can be assigned to a specific {@link ConnectionTask}
 * but it can also be assigned to the default {@link ConnectionTask}.
 * In the first case, the ComTaskExecution is only executed when that
 * specific ConnectionTask executes. In the latter case,
 * the ComTaskExecution will be executed each time the default
 * ConnectionTask executes, regardless of which one is the default.
 * In other words, when the default changes, the execution of the
 * ComTaskExecution will also change.
 * <p>
 * The execution can be prioritized with a simple numerical mechanism.
 * The priority is a positive number and smaller numbers indicate higher priority.
 * In other words, zero is the highest priority.
 * This way the priority mechanism has a fixed and absolute highest priority
 * and it is not possible for an administrator to add a task to a running system
 * and give it the absolute highest priority by searching
 * the highest existing priority and adding one to it.
 * A practical example of task priorities is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>100: highest priority</li>
 * <li>200</li>
 * <li>300</li>
 * <li>400</li>
 * <li>500: lowest priority</li>
 * </ul>
 * The above still leaves some room for urgent high priority tasks to be scheduled
 * and executed before all others.
 * <p>
 * Each time a ComTaskExecution is executed,
 * a ComTaskExecutionSession is created
 * that captures all the details of the communication with the device.
 * That communication overview is very imported and should not be deleted easily.
 * Therefore, ComTaskExecutions are never deleted but made obsolete.
 * Obsolete ComTaskExecutions will not return from {@link DeviceService}
 * finder methods.
