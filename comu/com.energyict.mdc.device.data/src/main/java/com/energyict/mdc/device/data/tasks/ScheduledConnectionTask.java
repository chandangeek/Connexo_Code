/**
 * Models a {@link ConnectionTask} that is used in the context
 * of outbound communication, i.e. when the ComServer is setting
 * up the communication.
 * A ScheduledConnectionTask can be recurring in time,
 * i.e. it will connect to its related device on a frequent basis.
 * <p/>
 * It uses a {@link ConnectionStrategy} to calculate the next time
 * if will connect based on the timestamp it has last executed.
 * <p/>
 * The used strategy can decide to optimize the number of connections
 * in which case all communication with the linked devices will be executed
 * during the same communication session. A single connection is established
 * according to a frequency and an offset to midnight
 * (e.g. every day at midnight, every week at 2 a.m., ...).
 * <p/>
 * When the strategy is to execute communication as soon as possible,
 * then the frequency of establishing the connection is not used
 * but the frequency settings will be taken from the {@link ComTaskExecution}s
 * that are found on the related devices.
 * <p/>
 * It supports only one {@link ConnectionMethod}s and will keep track
 * of the values of the related {@link ConnectionTaskProperty ConnectionTaskProperties}.
