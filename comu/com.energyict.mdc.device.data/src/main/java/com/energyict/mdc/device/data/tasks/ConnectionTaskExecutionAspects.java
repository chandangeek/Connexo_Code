 * Todo:
 * Used to add behavior to {@link ConnectionTask} that is private
 * to the server side implementation but will need to be refactored
 * to a wrapper entity in the mdc.engine bundle.
 * The ComServer attribute of a ConnectionTask will move to that wrapper entity
 * and implement the behavior that was on ConnectionTask before that relates to execution.
 * Current validation constraints on ConnectionTaskImpl e.g. that prohibit a ConnectionTask
 * from being obsoleted when it is being executed will obviously need to be moved too.
