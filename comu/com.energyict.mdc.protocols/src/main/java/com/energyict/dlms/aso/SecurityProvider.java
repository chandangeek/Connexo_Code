 * @change 3th nov. 2009 - Added the getNEWLLSSecret method
 * @change 17th oct. 2021 - Added methods to change the used encryption and authentication keys instantly, this should be called after setting new keys to devices that use them instantly.
 * @change 22th oct. 2012 - Added the getNEWAuthenticationKeys method and getNEWEncryptionKeys method, returning a string array of the original and the wrapped key.
