 * Overview of the component names that are used

 * for each of the {@link com.elster.jupiter.cps.CustomPropertySet}s
 * that are contained in this protocol bundles.
 * <p>
 * This overview is important because each CustomPropertySet needs
 * to have a unique {@link com.elster.jupiter.orm.DataModel}
 * and the component name determines the name of that DataModel.
 * <p>
 * If you are creating a completely new CustomPropertySet then add a new
 * enum element and refer to it from the related PersistenceSupport class.
