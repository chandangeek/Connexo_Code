/**
 * Adapts a ComChannel so that it behaves as an OutputStream.
 * This is only required for backwards compatibility with old-style
 * communication protocols such as {@link MeterProtocol}
 * and {@link SmartMeterProtocol}
 * that need an OutputStream (and an OutputStream) at initialization time.
 * The ComServer statistics however, rely on the fact that all communication
 * goes through the ComChannel methods and no calls are made to
 * the underlying OutputStream directly.
 * Because the old-style communication protocols are not aware of the
 * synhroneous nature of a ComChannel, it will invoke
 * startWriting at the appropriate time.
