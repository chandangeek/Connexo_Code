/**
 * Models issues that are found by a process while it's executing.
 * Some issues may be fixable or worked around. These are called warnings.<br>
 * Others may be real problems that need changes before the process can be completed successfully.<br>
 * Issues can optionally be reported against a source object, i.e. the object that causes the issue.
 * This could be useful when the process is e.g. a validation process, in which case the source
 * will most likely be the object that has a validation issue.
