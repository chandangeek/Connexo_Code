/**
 * Represents a request from an interested party to
 * register an interest in events that occur
 * in the {@link com.energyict.mdc.engine.model.ComServer}.
 * Note that it is allowed to register multiple times and narrow down
 * the interests to limit the amount of events received.
 * Note also that the interest can be registered multiple
 * time so e.g. change the interest in events that
 * relate to one {@link com.energyict.mdc.protocol.api.device.BaseDevice device} to another device.
 * <p>
 * Making the initial request is done through the
 * {@link EventRegistrationRequestInitiator}
 * which will give you the URL on which you can post Requests
 * via WebSocket technology.
