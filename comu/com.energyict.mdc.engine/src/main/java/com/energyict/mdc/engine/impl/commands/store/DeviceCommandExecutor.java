/**
 * Models the behavior of a component that will execute {@link DeviceCommand}s.
 * Note that implementations may delay the execution of a DeviceCommand
 * until there are enough system resources available.
 * <p>
 * To ensure that the rate at which new DeviceCommands are generated
 * is more or less in line with the rate at which these DeviceCommands
 * can be executed, it is necessary to prepare the execution.
 * Creating a DeviceCommand is usually a time consuming process
 * and it would be a shame to find out after the DeviceCommand
 * is created that there are actually not enough resources to execute it.
 * It is only when the preparation succeeds that new DeviceCommands
 * can be presented for execution. If despite of preparation failure,
 * DeviceCommands are executed, that execution will immediately fail
 * with a {@link NoResourcesAcquiredException}.
