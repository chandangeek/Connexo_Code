/**
 * Models an event as in something that happened or took place
 * within the ComServer.
 * There are different {@link Category categories} of events.
 * Client application can register interests for events
 * and then receive those interest as and when they occur.
 * Some events will relate to one or more business objects.
 * Test methods are provided for each type of business object.
 * Also when a ComServerEvent returns <code>true</code> for
 * one of these test methods, it is guaranted that it should
 * be possible to cast that instance to the related XXXRelatedEvent class
 * to obtain that business object. As an example:
 * when {@link #isDeviceRelated()} returns <code>true</code> then
 * the ComServerEvent can be cast to {@link DeviceRelatedEvent}
 * and calling {@link DeviceRelatedEvent#getDevice()} will NOT return <code>null</code>.
 * <pre><code>
 *     ComServerEvent event = ...
 *     if (event.isDeviceRelated()) {
 *         DeviceRelatedEvent deviceEvent = (DeviceRelatedEvent) event;
 *         Device device = deviceEvent.getDevice();
 *         System.out.println(device.getName());
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
