# This should be absolute path to JSS (Maintenance) exported configuration (used to initialize JSS)

# Following configuration is needed to add flexibility on import feature: allowing to use different labels in imported files.
# With this approach however we will allow only one mapping, perhaps a better approach would be to add this mapping on importer configuration
# allowing mapping for each importer.

# all labels with structure: hs.config.label.<>

# format hsm.config.label.[HSM-LABEL] = [FILE-LABEL]
# where:
#				 HSM-LABEL a label that is provisioned inside HSM
#                FILE-LABEL is the corresponding label present in import file. If values are the same in file and HSM you can omit this field.
