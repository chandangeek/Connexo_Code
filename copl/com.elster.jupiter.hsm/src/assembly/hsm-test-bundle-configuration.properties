# format hsm.config.label.[HSM-LABEL] = [FILE-LABEL],[IMPORT-HSM-LABEL],[IMPORT-CAPABILITY],[DEVICE-KEY-LENGTH],[RENEW-CAPABILITY]
# where:
#				 HSM-LABEL a label that is provisioned inside HSM
#                FILE-LABEL is the corresponding label present in import file. If values are the same in file and HSM you can omit this field.
#				 IMPORT-HSM-LABEL this is a HSM configured label that will be used in import phase for key re-encryption.
#				 IMPORT-CAPABILITY as defined in HSM/JSS, like SM_KEK_NONAUTHENTIC or SM_KEK_AUTHENTIC. This depends on label configuration provisioned in HSM. This capability will be used for import operation.
#				 DEVICE-KEY-LENGTH if current label is used to encrypt device keys we need to specify device key length.
#				 RENEW-CAPABILITY as defined in HSM/JSS, like SM_KEK_RENEW. This depends on label configuration provisioned in HSM. This capability will be used for renew operation.
# Any of the configured values above can be missing at load time with no effect on bundle functionality, for instance if on label will not be used or does not have import capability simply leave empty string, however
# since the value for a certain label configuration is CSV format we need to add separators (comma).

# Following key does not have import capability but has renew, this means likely this is a label used only for key storage and renew.
# Also following label does not require mapping.
