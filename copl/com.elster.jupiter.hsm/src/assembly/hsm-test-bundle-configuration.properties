# This should be absolute path to JSS (Maintenance) exported configuration (used to initialize JSS)
hsm.config.jss.init.file = hsm-runtime-configuration.json


# Following configuration is needed to add flexibility on import feature: allowing to use different labels in imported files.
# With this approach however we will allow only one mapping, perhaps a better approach would be to add this mapping on importer configuration
# allowing mapping for each importer.

# all labels with structure: hs.config.label.<>

# format hsm.config.label.[HSM-LABEL] = [FILE-LABEL], [CHAINING-MODE], [PADDING-ALGORITHM]
# where:
#				 HSM-LABEL a label that is provisioned inside HSM
#                FILE-LABEL is the corresponding label present in import file. If values are the same in file and HSM you can omit this field.
#                CHAINING-MODE can have following one of the following JSS values: ECB,CBC,CFB or OFB;
#                              This will be used as default values for calling Symmetric encrypt/decrypt when not specified otherwise (gogo commands for instance or for storage of reversible keys). If key is reversible then we use Symmetric encrypt in storage phase with these default values.
#                PADDING-ALGORITHM can have following one of the following JSS values: NONE, NULL, LEFT_NULL, ISO_9797_80M, ISO_9797_O80, ANSI_X9_23, EMSA_PKCS1_V1_5, EME_PKCS1_V1_5, PKCS .
#                                  can have following one of the following JSS values: ECB,CBC,CFB or OFB; This will be used as default values for calling Symmetric encrypt/decrypt when not specified otherwise (gogo commands for instance or for storage of reversible keys). If key is reversible then we use Symmetric encrypt in storage phase with these default values.
#
# Since in import phase for reversible keys we need to call Symmetric.encrypt therefore we need it' storage label to be configured so we can use chaining mode and padding defined.
# Yet this is resolved by providing a default CBC and PKCS, if needed something else you just need to configure it
#
hsm.config.label.IMP-SM-KEK = Pub_KEK_SM, CBC, PKCS
hsm.config.label.IMP-S-SSH = Pub_KEK_SM, CBC, PKCS
hsm.config.label.S-SSH = S-SSH, CBC, PKCS
