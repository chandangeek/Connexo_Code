/**
 * Provides building services for {@link PropertySpec}s.
 * All methods that contribute to aspects of the PropertySpec
 * under construction will return the same PropertySpecBuilder
 * to support method chaning.<br>
 * Two aspects (name and description) of a PropertySpec are
 * designed to support translation to all the Connexo languages.
 * The preferred way is to use the API with {@link TranslationKey}s but
 * an alternative API that uses simple Strings is available too.
 * Note however that switching between the two alternatives
 * is not supported. In other words, you need to decide
 * if you want to build a PropertySpec whose name and description
 * are backed by the {@link com.elster.jupiter.nls.NlsService}
 * or if you want to hard code the name and description.
 * Mixing the two APIs will result in an IllegalStateException.
 * <br>
 * Finally, the client code will call the finish method when all
 * aspects of the PropertySpec have been specified.
