<p>This bundle provides support for finate state machines.
The main interface is FinateStateMachine, a named wrapper for a set of States and StateTransitions.
Every State can be configured to trigger one or more external processes on entry and on exit.
As events are produced, the finate state machine will respond to the event and change the state accordingly.
When state actually changes, a new event is produced that can be picked up by other components
that could e.g. change the actual persisted state of a device.
Events are globally defined and can therefore be reused across different state machines.
Currently, the external processes are defined in jBPM but are not started yet.
