/**
 * A finite state machine, sometimes also called finite state automaton or simply state machine,
 * is a mathematical model of computation and is conceived as an abstract machine that
 * can be in a finite number of states (hence the name).
 * The machine is in exactly one state at any time and that state is called the current state.
 * The state changes as events are {@link StateTransitionTriggerEvent triggered}.
 * The changing of state due to these events is referred to as a state transition.
 * Therefore, a state machine is defined by the list of its states and the {@link StateTransitionEventType}s
 * that trigger each transition.
 * One of the states is called the initial state, i.e. the state in which the machine is
 * when first created. A subset of the states can be final, indicating that once
 * the machine is in that state, the state will no longer change.
 * Every state that has no outgoing transitions is by consequence a final state.
