<html><body><h1>com.elster.jupiter.events</h1>
<p>This bundle manages event definitions.
It registers a dataModel with the EVT acronym.
It provides access to three event mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Publish to com.energyict.pubsub, providing a synchronous event handling mechanism where the event subscriber runs in the same thread and transaction context as the publisher</li>
<li>Post to the OSGI Event Admin Service, providing asynchronous events in the same Java VM</li>
<li>Write to an Oracle Advanced Queuing MultiConsumer Queue (equivalent to a JMS topic), for processing by an other Java VM</li>
</ul>
Note that OSGI event handlers need to be carefull as they run in a different thread, and the transaction publishing the event may still be in progress,
or rollbacked by the time the event is processed. 
Handlers requiring transactional semantics should use Oracle AQ
