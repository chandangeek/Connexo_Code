# Unified apps integration

## Introduction

(Reasoning how the master application came to be, its use cases and scope.)

## How to integrate an existing application

(Structure of application and requirements.)

### Activator changes

(Minor activator example, with a parameter description.)

### Main controller changes

(How to change the main controller compared to a normal usage.)

## Considerations

* Since each application is loaded via its activator, there is no set order. Make sure the index values of menu
  items are set correctly to avoid unexpected results.
