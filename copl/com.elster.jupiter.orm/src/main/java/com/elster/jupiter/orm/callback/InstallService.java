     *
     * When you need to create a new InstallService, you change something to an existing InstallService or you change/create some
     * TableSpecs that have a foreign key to a table of a different module, you also need to modify the getPrerequisiteModules()
     * method. (So remark, you only need to indicate the modules on which the installer depends)
     *
     * To determine on which modules you depend
     * - you can look at all the @Reference services your installer gets injected
     * - have a look at all your TableSpecs and check all foreign key constraints to tables of different modules.
