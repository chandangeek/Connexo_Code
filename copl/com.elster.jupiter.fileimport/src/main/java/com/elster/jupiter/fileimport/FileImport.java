 * A FileImport is an occurrence of one file being imported.
 * It can be in one of 4 states :
 * <ul>
 *     <li>NEW : when the file is first detected to be imported.</li>
 *     <li>PROCESSING : when the file is awaiting processing, or being processed</li>
 *     <li>SUCCESS : when the file was processed successfully</li>
 *     <li>FAILURE : when the file was not processed successfully.</li>
 * </ul>
 * FileImport shields the actual file from the code that does the actual processing of its contents,
 * allowing the underlying file system to vary as needed.
