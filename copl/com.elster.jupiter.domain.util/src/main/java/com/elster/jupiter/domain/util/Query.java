/**
 * A Query is the object version of  a database join.
 * Unlike a traditional join, a Query has a main type,
 * and zero or more associated types. Actually the list of associated types constitute a
 * number of possible joins. Depending on the select conditions and the eagerness or lazyness,
 * the associated types may or may not be joined to the main type
 * The provider of the Query object decides which types can be joined to the main type.
 * If an associated type is the n part in a 0 to n association, criteria on the associated type
 * must be interpreted as main type HAS ANY associated type where
 * Also in this case, the collection containing the associated type will not be realized,
 * because the query will not return all the associated types.
