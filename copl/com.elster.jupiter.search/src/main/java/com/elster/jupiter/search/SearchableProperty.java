/**
 * Models a property of a {@link SearchDomain domain class}
 * that can be used for searching.
 * In other words, client code can use
 * a SearchableProperty to specify a query
 * that returns values of the SearchDomain
 * whose property is equal to a specified value.
 * <p>
 * Values of a SearchableProperty can be constraint by the
 * value of other properties.
 * Consider the animal life on our planet as an
 * example of a SearchDomain.
 * It could have "class" and "subclass" as a SearchableProperty.
 * When the user selects value "Vertebrates" as possible value
 * to search on then the list of possible values for "subclass"
 * will need to be updated. Also, as long as the user
 * has not made any specification on the "class"
 * it is not possible for the UI to compile a
 * list of "subclasses".
 * When user selects one or more value of the constraint property
 * then all dependent properties need to be refreshed.
 * Given that the user can select multiple properties,
 * the dependent properties will contain some possible values
 * that relate to the different selected constraint properties
 * and these may not necessarily be unique.
 * Therefore, the SearchableProperty will provide the display
 * for each of its values.
 * Also, not all values may be capable of producing a display value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Values of a SearchableProperty may result in more SearchableProperty
 * being available at the SearchDomain level.
 * Because the new properties are not available at the SearchDomain
 * level until a certain value of another SearchableProperty
 * has been selected, we cannot rely on the constraint
 * mechanism of SearchableProperty. Instead, a SearchableProperty
 * has a flag that indicates if selected/unselecting values
 * will affect the available properties at the SearchDomain level.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Currently, the fact that a {@link PropertySpec} can be
 * "required" or "optional" is not used.
 * A property's visibility is either "sticky" or "removable".
 * Sticky properties are intended to be always visible on the
 * search screen while "removable" ones may be removed by the
 * user when he no longer wants to search against that property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A SearchableProperty can be part of a group and all
 * properties of the same group are expected to be rendered
 * together in the UI to indicate to the user that they are
 * somehow related. A group could e.g. be used to indicate
 * that the properties in the group actually belong to
 * a related object of the actual SearchDomain.
 * </p>
