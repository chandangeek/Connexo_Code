<p>This bundle provides support for custom attributes.
The main interface is CustomPropertySet, a named wrapper for a set of PropertySpec.
The set of properties extend the properties of an existing domain class
and are treated as a consistent unit. The CustomPropertySet defines this domain class.
Every object of the domain class will therefore be extended with these properties
and the user will be able to specify values for the properties for every object
of the domain class.
A CustomPropertySet can be "versioned" at which point the history
of the changes are maintained at the object level.
</p>
<p>
The CustomPropertySetService provides a whiteboard on which CustomPropertySet components
are published. As they appear on the whiteboard, they are persisted so that other
services can reference the CustomPropertySet. Note that the services, when asked,
will provide a consistent view on the persistent CustomPropertySet. It will NOT
return a CustomPropertySet when it has not registered on the whiteboard (after e.g.
a system stop/start).
