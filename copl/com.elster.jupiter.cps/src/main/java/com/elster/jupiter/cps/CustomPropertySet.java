/**
 * Models the behavior of a component that will define
 * a custom set of properties that will extend the
 * standard properties of a domain class that is provided
 * by Connexo.
 * <p>
 * A CustomPropertySet is in essence a named wrapper for
 * a set of PropertySpecs. The implementator should consider
 * translating the name of the set using a Thesaurus.
 * In addition to providing the definition of the properties,
 * a CustomPropertySet will also provide a persistence class
 * that will be involved in validating business constraints.
 * A CustomPropertySet can be "versioned" at which point the history
 * of the values of every attribute are maintained at the object level.
 * Note that this also imposes requirements on the persistence class.
 * It should implement the {@link Effectivity} interface and have
 * a field of type {@link Interval} by the name of "interval".
 * A CustomPropertySet can also apply uniqueness constraints.
 * By default, the business object that is extended and
 * the CustomPropertySet are part of the primary key and if
 * if the CustomPropertySet is versioned then the start of the
 * effective interval is also part of the primary key.
 * Should that be necessary, the CustomPropertySet can add
 * additional primary key fields.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The unique identifier that a CustomPropertySet is expected to provide
 * should be unique across all sets that will exist at runtime
 * We think that the number of customizations per installation will be
 * limited such that managing the uniqueness will not be a problem,
 * even when the service and delivery team defines reusable attribute sets
 * that they use across customers.
 * The case where the same persistence class is used for different
 * CustomPropertySets is supported as long as every CustomPropertySet
 * has a unique identifier.
 * </p>
