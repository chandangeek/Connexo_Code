com	7	b	128	255	255	255	Gas related manufacturer specific objects				If any group B to F contains a value in the manufacturer specific range, the whole code is considered as manufacturer specific and even the other value groups, (with the exception of group A) are not necessarily bearing any meaning defined by this standard. In all groups, the value 255 means "not used". Manufacturer specific objects can be of any class. The manufacturer must ensure that each and every COSEM object within the logical device can be uniquely identified by the combination of its OBIS name and interface class.
